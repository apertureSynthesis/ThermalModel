Pipeline for generating thermal models of asteroids for comparison against observations. Uses KRC model inputs to generate radiative temperature profiles, 
which are then converted to surface emission at a given frequency. 

Many of the routines are adapted from Drs. Jian-Yang Li and Xiao-Duan Zou.
